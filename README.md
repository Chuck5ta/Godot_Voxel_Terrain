# Godot_Voxel_Terrain
This is my Godot game engine version of a tool to create a terrain made up of manipulatable voxels (My Unity project is the main one. After completing sections of that project, I will then implement them in this and other game engine projects I create. At this moment in time, only the Unity and Godot projects exist)).  

This is the first part of a greater project to create a voxel world where I can bring to life my creations (3D models, 2D art, AI, etc.) 

At present, the only part that will be made up of manipulatable voxels, will be the terrain.
